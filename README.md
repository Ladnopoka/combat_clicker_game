# Combat Clicker
Combat Clicker is a browser-based, turn-based game where you face off against a cunning rat warrior. Your goal is simple: outthink and outmaneuver the rat to come out victorious! The game features a strategic mix of attack and defense, requiring players to carefully choose where to strike and where to defend.

How to Play
Choose Your Attack:

Pick 2 out of 5 possible attack positions: head, body, legs, arms, or tail.
Every attack has the potential to deal varying damage based on your choices.
Defend Against the Rat Warrior:

The rat will retaliate! You must guess where it will strike and choose 2 out of 5 positions to defend: head, body, legs, arms, or tail.
If you guess correctly, you block the damage; if not, you'll take a hit.
Combat Log:

The game features a combat log that keeps track of all the damage dealt and received during the fight. It’s a great way to review your strategy and see how well you’re doing.
