# Combat Clicker

**Combat Clicker** is a browser-based, turn-based game where you face off against a cunning rat warrior. Your goal is simple: get lucky and guess the right option to defeat the rat! The game features a mix of attack and defense options, requiring players to choose where to strike and where to defend.

## How to Play

### Choose Your Attack:
- Pick **2 out of 5 possible attack positions**:
  - Head
  - Body
  - Legs
  - Arms
  - Waist

### Defend Against the Rat Warrior:
- The rat will retaliate! You must guess where it will strike and choose **2 out of 5 positions** to defend:
  - Head
  - Body
  - Legs
  - Arms
  - Waist
- If you guess correctly, you block the damage; if not, you'll take a hit.

### Combat Log:
- The game features a **combat log** that keeps track of all the damage dealt and received during the fight.
- It’s a great way to see how well you’re doing.
